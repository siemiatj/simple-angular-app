## What & why ?
This is a simple app built to learn Google's Material design and experiment with Webpack. 
Leverages public JSON API's with some placeholder data:
* http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
* http://placehold.it

As an experiment some data is stored in a Redux store as an Immutable structure.
Just remember that it's a very naive implementation. To get all the sweet
features and better experience you should use something like [ng-redux](https://github.com/angular-redux/ng-redux)

## How ?

Bootstrapped using [angular-modern-boilerplate](https://github.com/siemiatj/angular-modern-boilerplate)
with :

* Angular
* Redux
* ImmutableJS
* [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/)
* Webpack
* Babel

## Setup 
You need node with npm installed. Then run:

`npm install`

to install the dependencies, and :

`npm start`

to start a local server at `localhost:8080`.
