## What & why ?
I wanted to learn Material Design as well as improve my webpack knowledge and that's how this project came to life. Simple app
with RWD design leveraging public JSON API's.

## Setup 
You need node with npm installed. Then run:

`npm install`

to install the dependencies.

Then run :

`npm start`

to start a local server at `localhost:8080`.
